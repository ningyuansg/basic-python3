Introduction
============

Welcome to a simple **Introduction to Python with Telegram Bots**! The agenda
for this workshop is briefly to,

1. Calculate the average of a pre-prepared set of air temperatures readings.
2. Find the average air temperature using **real-time** air temperature data
   from NEA.
3. Make a telegram bot that will send you **real-time** air temperature data
   from NEA **on demand**.
